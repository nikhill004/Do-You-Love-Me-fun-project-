# 💖 Do You Love Me?  

A fun and interactive web project made with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The twist? You can never click **"No"** 😏 — it keeps running away!  
But if you click **"Yes"**, the app replies with *"Love you too ❤️"*.

## 🚀 Features
- **Playful "No" button**: Moves randomly whenever you try to hover on it.
- **"Yes" button**: Clicking it shows a sweet "Love you too" message.
- Lightweight and responsive design.
- Pure **Vanilla JS**, no libraries required.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, random positioning)

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
2. Try clicking **"No"** (good luck 😆).  
3. Click **"Yes"** to get the surprise message.  

## 📂 Project Setup
Just clone or download the files and open `index.html` in your browser. No extra setup needed.
